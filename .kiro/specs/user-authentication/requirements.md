# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document defines the requirements for a user authentication system that will provide secure login, logout, and password reset functionality for the recruitment application. The system will enable users to create accounts, authenticate securely, and manage their credentials.

## Glossary

- **Authentication_System**: The software component responsible for verifying user identity and managing user sessions
- **User**: An individual who interacts with the recruitment application and requires authenticated access
- **Session**: A temporary authenticated state that persists user login status across application interactions
- **Credential**: User authentication information including username/email and password
- **Password_Reset_Token**: A temporary, secure token used to verify password reset requests
- **Login_Form**: The user interface component that collects user credentials for authentication
- **Registration_Form**: The user interface component that collects information for new user account creation

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to create an account with email and password, so that I can access the recruitment application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits valid registration information, THE Authentication_System SHALL create a new user account
2. THE Authentication_System SHALL validate email format and password strength requirements
3. IF an email address already exists, THEN THE Authentication_System SHALL display an appropriate error message
4. THE Authentication_System SHALL require passwords to contain at least 8 characters with mixed case and numbers
5. WHEN account creation succeeds, THE Authentication_System SHALL automatically log in the new user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to log in with my credentials, so that I can access my personalized recruitment dashboard.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits valid credentials, THE Authentication_System SHALL authenticate the user and create a session
2. THE Authentication_System SHALL display appropriate error messages for invalid credentials
3. WHEN authentication succeeds, THE Authentication_System SHALL redirect the user to the main application
4. THE Authentication_System SHALL maintain user session state across browser refreshes
5. IF login attempts exceed 5 failures within 15 minutes, THEN THE Authentication_System SHALL temporarily lock the account

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want to log out securely, so that my account remains protected when I'm done using the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates logout, THE Authentication_System SHALL terminate the current session
2. THE Authentication_System SHALL clear all authentication tokens from browser storage
3. WHEN logout completes, THE Authentication_System SHALL redirect the user to the login page
4. THE Authentication_System SHALL prevent access to protected routes after logout
5. THE Authentication_System SHALL automatically log out users after 24 hours of inactivity

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user who forgot my password, I want to reset it using my email address, so that I can regain access to my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests password reset with valid email, THE Authentication_System SHALL send a reset link to that email
2. THE Authentication_System SHALL generate a secure Password_Reset_Token that expires within 1 hour
3. WHEN a user clicks the reset link, THE Authentication_System SHALL validate the token and allow password change
4. THE Authentication_System SHALL require the new password to meet strength requirements
5. WHEN password reset completes, THE Authentication_System SHALL invalidate all existing sessions for that user

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want my authentication state to persist across browser sessions, so that I don't have to log in repeatedly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Authentication_System SHALL store authentication tokens securely in browser storage
2. WHEN a user returns to the application, THE Authentication_System SHALL validate stored tokens
3. IF stored tokens are valid, THEN THE Authentication_System SHALL restore the user session
4. THE Authentication_System SHALL refresh tokens before expiration to maintain continuous access
5. WHEN tokens are invalid or expired, THE Authentication_System SHALL require re-authentication
